## RICKPIC AND MORTY-SCHMORTY: WHY THE HELL ARE YOU HERE?
Well, anyway, search for someone, get to know them for 3.7 seconds, then get bored I guess...

## MVP
- Webiste opens with the Rick and Morty logo and a search bar under it, a slogan will be under the search bar.
- When you enter a name of a character it will go to a page with an image of the character and it will display theyre status (alive, dead, ect.), species, gender, and location.
- components:
1. Login/out
2. Profile-info
3. Home
4. All Characters
5. Single Character Protrait
6. Back button?
